# About **Leo**

<div class="post">
    <h2>Hello! My name is Leo,</h2>

    and I've been an interstellar traveller my whole life, exploring the stars and the galaxies ever since I was young. When exploring the galaxy, there are so many things to be seen, and to be recorded. The universe is vast and expansive, so theres always something new to write about!

    My journey started all the way back on Earth... When I was a kid, I would look at the stars in the night sky and wish, "I want to see what's out there!". When I went to sleep that night, my wish had been granted because when I woke up, I found myself in a spaceship a million miles away from home. And to be honest, I think I found a new home out here. 

    Since then, I've been travelling galaxy to galaxy in search of anything crazy I can find, and I want to share that knowledge with the rest of Earth.
