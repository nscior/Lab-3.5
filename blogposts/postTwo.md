**TITLE:** A Discovery!

<div class="post">
Well guys... I stumbled upon something.

And I need to share it! Drum roll please...

I found another planet!! The planet is in the Other Side Galaxy, 4th planet in the Swan System. It's around the same size as Earth, and yes, I am exploring.

I just flew down into the atmosphere and landed onto some solid ground. My ship ran some tests on the environment on the planet, and there are some very promising readings! Specifically, the results are showing that there is oxygen and moisture present in the air!

I opened the shutters on the window and my jaw dropped... theres.. life! Turns out I landed in the middle of a forest, and there are a bunch of snapped trees under my ship... that may take a second to repair. Luckily I have tools and my spacesuit just in case.

But let's get back to the topic at hand. I see trees, grass, moss, flowers... This means there has to be water somewhere on this planet. I'll write an update after I fix my ship, and try and find some if I can! Stay tuned for more updates!
