**TITLE:** Happy New Year!

<br>
<div class="post">
Happy New Year back to my friends on Earth! It was a spectacular night in New York, huh?

For my New Years, I flew back home and watched the ball dropped at midnight. It was great to see everone out in the streets celebrating! There were a lot of performances throughout the night too, lots of nice singers, dancers, and partying that I enjoyed watching. I got some of the Planet Fitness merch like the hat and a balloon, and its a nice memento to bring back with me on the ship. I wonder what my friends in space would think of these things?

Did you know that Earth isn't the only place that celebrates New Years? All of the other planets that have life on them also like to celebrate that night! Of course, it isn't with a giant ball in a city, but there are definitely some celebrations, gatherings, and fun activites to do off of Earth. I highly reccommend checking out the planet Zel, their New Years celebrations revolve around light; they take many colors and throw them into the night sky, kindof like celebrating with fireworks. Maybe I'll give them some next time I visit!
